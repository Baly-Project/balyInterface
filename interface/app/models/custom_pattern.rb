class CustomPattern
  #this is a user-input class that forces screening of patterns before they are displayed
  #Updates must occur on this file (the version in interface/app/models)
  
  
# The first hash represents keywords that are completely included within others.
# This should be reserved for logical subsets and avoid coincidences.
# To update, generate the possible subsets by opening a terminal, entering irb, and loading 
# methods.rb. Then type collectKeywordPatterns and hit enter, and a list of all the possible 
# patterns present in the digital kenyon data will appear. Then copy/paste lines directly into this
